# PR readiness check scripts

## Executive summary

This ticket provides a small script set for checking whether a GitHub pull request is ready to merge under the workflow used in the logcopter rollout: all Actions/status checks must have run and succeeded, and Codex must have finished review with a thumbs-up rather than an in-progress eyes reaction or substantive review comments.

The operator entry point is `scripts/00-pr-ready-check.sh`, a Bash wrapper around `scripts/01-pr-ready-check.py`. It is intentionally non-mutating and exits with status `0` only when the PR is ready. It can be run against a single PR URL or wrapped by future batch scripts that iterate through many repositories.

## Problem statement

When rolling changes through multiple go-go-golems repositories, manual PR readiness checks become repetitive and easy to misread. The desired ready state is stricter than "checks are green": Codex review must also be satisfied. In the observed GitHub UI flow, Codex uses reactions on an `@codex review` trigger comment: an eyes reaction indicates review is running, and a thumbs-up indicates successful review. If Codex leaves substantive comments, the PR is not ready even if CI is green.

A reusable script should therefore answer four questions:

1. Did Actions/status checks run?
2. Are all checks completed with acceptable conclusions?
3. Is there a Codex review signal?
4. Does the newest Codex signal indicate done/satisfied rather than running/unsatisfied?

## Proposed solution

### Script layout

```text
scripts/
  00-pr-ready-check.sh       # bash entry point for operators
  01-pr-ready-check.py       # non-mutating readiness check implementation
  02-trigger-codex-review.sh # posts '@codex review'
  03-watch-codex-reactions.py# polls until a Codex signal appears
```

### Readiness model

A PR is ready when all of the following are true:

- `statusCheckRollup` contains at least one check/status.
- Every check run is `COMPLETED` and has conclusion `SUCCESS`, `SKIPPED`, or `NEUTRAL`.
- Every legacy status context has state `SUCCESS`.
- A Codex signal exists. A signal is either:
  - a Codex-authored review/comment, matched by configurable author regex; or
  - a human comment whose body is exactly `@codex review`, because Codex reacts to that trigger comment.
- The latest Codex signal has at least one `THUMBS_UP` reaction, or a Codex-authored body explicitly says no major issues and includes a thumbs-up token such as `:+1:`.
- The latest Codex signal has no `EYES` reaction.
- If the latest signal is Codex-authored, its body is empty/benign/satisfied; substantive body text with suggestions means the review likely requested changes or left comments.

### Why trigger comments are signals

Initial testing on Pinocchio PR 158 showed that after posting `@codex review`, the PR comment received an `EYES` reaction while Codex was running. That means the relevant in-progress state may be attached to the human trigger comment rather than a bot-authored review object. The script treats the latest exact `@codex review` comment as a Codex signal and checks its reactions.

## Usage examples

Check one PR:

```bash
scripts/00-pr-ready-check.sh https://github.com/go-go-golems/pinocchio/pull/158
```

Machine-readable output:

```bash
scripts/00-pr-ready-check.sh https://github.com/go-go-golems/pinocchio/pull/158 --json
```

Trigger Codex review:

```bash
scripts/02-trigger-codex-review.sh https://github.com/go-go-golems/pinocchio/pull/158
```

Watch for a Codex reaction signal:

```bash
scripts/03-watch-codex-reactions.py https://github.com/go-go-golems/pinocchio/pull/158 --interval 30 --timeout 900
```

## Implementation notes

The checker uses `gh api graphql` rather than scraping HTML. It queries:

- `statusCheckRollup.contexts.nodes` for check runs and legacy status contexts;
- `reviews` for Codex-authored review objects;
- `comments` for exact `@codex review` trigger comments;
- `reactionGroups` for `THUMBS_UP` and `EYES` reaction counts.

The default Codex author regex is intentionally broad:

```text
(?i)(^|[-_])(codex|openai-codex|chatgpt)([-_]|$)|codex|openai
```

If the organization standardizes on a specific bot login, pass a narrower value:

```bash
scripts/01-pr-ready-check.py OWNER/REPO#123 --codex-author-regex '^openai-codex\[bot\]$'
```

## Observed Pinocchio test output

After temporarily pushing an intentionally bad workflow change and commenting `@codex review`, the checker observed the in-progress state:

```text
READY: no
FAIL: pending checks: Analyze: status=IN_PROGRESS; lint: status=IN_PROGRESS; GoSec Security Scan: status=IN_PROGRESS
OK: latest Codex signal (codex-trigger) by wesen: https://github.com/go-go-golems/pinocchio/pull/158#issuecomment-4546486328
FAIL: latest Codex signal has no thumbs-up reaction
FAIL: latest Codex signal has 1 eyes reaction(s), review may still be running
OK: latest signal is a human @codex review trigger; body comments are not treated as review findings
```

That verifies the script can detect the eyes/in-progress state. A subsequent Codex review on the intentionally bad commit produced a substantive Codex-authored body, which the checker also treated as not ready. After reverting the bad commit, a later Codex comment said it did not find major issues and included `:+1:`; the checker now treats that body form as a satisfied thumbs-up signal even when GitHub reaction counts do not include `THUMBS_UP`.

## Risks and open questions

- GitHub's GraphQL schema can vary by host/version. The script already had to avoid unsupported `statusCheckRollup(first:)` and unsupported `CheckRun.workflowName` fields.
- Reaction identity is currently summarized by count. If unrelated users add thumbs-up or eyes reactions to the trigger comment, the script could misread the Codex state. The query already fetches reaction user logins for future tightening, but the first version checks counts.
- Codex may sometimes leave review findings as inline review comments rather than a review body. Future versions should query review threads/comments if this becomes common.
- The exact satisfied signal should be revalidated after a full successful Codex review cycle, because this pass verified the running `EYES` state but not yet a completed `THUMBS_UP` state.

## Implementation plan for future batch mode

1. Store a list of PR URLs in a file.
2. Loop over the URLs and run `01-pr-ready-check.py --json`.
3. Emit a table with ready/not-ready status and failed criteria.
4. Only merge PRs where the script exits `0`.
5. For not-ready PRs with no Codex signal, optionally run `02-trigger-codex-review.sh`.
6. For PRs with eyes reactions, wait and rerun later.
